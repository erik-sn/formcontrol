# Form Control

### A CRUD application to end CRUD applications (sort of)

CRUD stands for create-update-delete; the three most basic functions
you can operate on data with. Instead of creating many CRUD applications
that all have a similar function (data entry and analysis), this is an attempt
to create one application that allows users to generate their own forms and
provide an interface to export, display, plot, and analyze the data that is put in.

#### Motivation
At work we have a lot of data, and a lot of that data is manually input. Right now
we have Excel spreadsheets stacked high and growing higher that people use to insert
this data. There is increased demand to move these
data entry applications into more purpose-built applications. So instead of building
an equally high stack of CRUD apps, lets try to build just one.

#### Technology
The core technologies are React/Redux and TypeScript.
